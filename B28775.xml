            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS,</hi> Humbly Offered to the Honourable <hi>House of Commons;</hi> by the Master, Wardens, and Society of the Art and Mystery of <hi>APOTHECARIES, London:</hi> For the Exempting them from certain Offices and Duties.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THE Business of the <hi>APOTHECARIES</hi> being to Attend the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty, residing within this Populous City, and Places adjacent; (or resorting thither on Publick Occasions,) under the several Maladies and Diseases that daily happen; they cannot Perform the same answerable to the great Trust reposed in them, without a constant Attendance on their Shops and Profession.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is found by Experience, nothing is a greater Hindrance to them therein, than their being obliged to Serve the several Parish, Ward, and Leet Offices in the Places where they live; and being continually put on Watches and Juries, which take up a great Part of their Time; whereby it often happens, that by Summons or Office they are obliged to be in one Place, and at the same time have been sent for, and by the Duty of their Profession, ought to Attend the Sick at another Place: the one they could not omit, without Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor neglect the other, without Prejudice to the Patient.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Their Profession differs from most others; having no Vacation, no time of the Year, nor Hour of the Day or Night free; but are always bound to wait, not knowing when they shall be wanted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Their Profession seems to have as reasonable a Claim, as the other Branches of PHYSICK, to an Exemption from the like Publick Offices; they not only attending the Physician at his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, but are expected in the Operation, and frequently to sit up with their Patients in Dangerous cases: And were it not for their charitable Visiting the Poor, many in this City would be lost.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The said Society, at a great Expence, have done several things that tend as well to the Honour of the NATION, and Faculty of PHYSICK in general; as for the Benefit and Instruction of their own Members in Particular:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>By Making a Publick</hi> ELABORATORY, <hi>for the faithful Preparation of all</hi> Chymical Medicines: <hi>that none might be imposed on by those, who through Lucre or Ignorance, Sell for Good, such as are Dangerous and Destructive.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>By Making a Publick</hi> PHYSICK-GARDEN, <hi>and Furnishing it with great Variety of</hi> Foreign <hi>and</hi> Domestick Plants; <hi>equal to if not exceeding most others in</hi> EUROPE.</item>
